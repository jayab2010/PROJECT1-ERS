# Expense Reimbursement System

## Project Description
This project manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

## Technologies Used
Used DAO design pattern to properly separate the code into the appropriate layers like Models, DAO, Service, and Controllers, as well as having CRUD implementations.
Used JUnit testing and Mockito for testing our requests. 
Used JDBC to talk to the PostgreSQL database(Back-End).
Used Javelin to create the webserver, and process HTTP requests from the client.
The front-end view is created using ReactJS.
